📖 Overview

Welcome to my Problem Solving Journey repository! 🚀
This repository documents my progress in Competitive Programming. It serves as a collection of my solutions to algorithmic problems, primarily from Codeforces, starting from the basics and progressing to more complex challenges.

My goal is to build a strong foundation in Data Structures, Algorithms, and logical thinking through consistent practice.

📂 Repository Structure

The repository is currently organized by difficulty level, starting with the fundamentals:

Problem-Solving/
├── Codeforces/
│   └── Level-A/       # Introductory Problems (Rating: 800)
│                      # Focus: Implementation, Math, Basics
└── README.md


Note: New levels and folders will be added as I progress to higher ratings.
